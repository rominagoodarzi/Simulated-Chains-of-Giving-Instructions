###Simulated Chains of Giving Instructions 

In this study initial participants were asked to complete 20 captchas and then were given a chance to complete additional captchas (0 to 20) for the next participant as an act of kindness. 

Initial participants were “seeded” with an act of kindness as well. They were told that a previous participant had already completed some of their required 20 captchas as an act of kindness, now they only had to complete the remaining captchas. 

To illustrate: A participant would learn that a previous participant completed 8 captchas for them already and now they only had to complete 12 of their 20 required captchas. After this participant completed these 12 captchas, they indicated how many additional captchas they wanted to complete for the next person. This participant might indicate they want to complete 10 captchas as an act of kindness for the next participant. 

Initial participants were assigned to one of 21 conditions varying the number of captchas that were initially given to them. The amounts varied from 0 (i.e., no captchas completed for them) to 20 (i.e., all of the captchas completed already). 

All participants could choose anywhere from 0 to 20 captchas to complete for the next participant. 

#Description of Data:

The excel file contains the data from my experiment with the following columns:
ID: participant ID
Initial_amt: condition assignment varying the initial amount of captchas completed for participant, ranges 0-20
PIF_amt: amount of captchas completed for next participant, ranges 0-20 

#Simulation:

Based on the amounts initial participants pay forward to the next participant, I simulated how many captchas this next participant would pay forward and so on. 

I also produced the following graph of simulated chains of 6 rounds in length for initial amount conditions 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. The x-axis represents the round of giving, the y-axis indicates the number of captchas completed, and there is a line for each initial amount condition.
